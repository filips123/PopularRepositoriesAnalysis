## Usage

### Scraping Data

Before running the API scrapers, you need to create [a read-only token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Popular%20Repositories%20Analysis) and store it inside the `scraper/auth.txt` file.

To collect all the required data, you can run the API scrapers with the following commands:

```shell
# Repositories Scraper
python scraper/main.py repositories stars # Top repositories by stars
python scraper/main.py repositories forks # Top repositories by forks

# Users Scraper
python scraper/main.py users followers # Top users by forks
python scraper/main.py users repositories # Top users by repositories
```

Each of the commands will take approximately 5â€“20 minutes to complete. The collected data will be stored inside the `data` directory.
